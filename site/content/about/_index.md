Hi, nice to meet you! My name is Mingzi **Ariana** **RAO**, a **Chinese** girl exploring her life in **France**.

Originally from a small city called **Chengde**, I am proud of what it holds in as culture and beauty. Born as an **adventurer**, I never stopped dreaming of seeing a wider world. Thanks to my Bachelor's courses and its **exchange program** with **Sorbonne University**, I got the chance to continue my studies in France and know this country.

During my time at Sorbonne finishing my Master of **International Business and Management**, I became interested in **digital marketing** and its related fields. Hoping to turn my inner interests into practical skills, I am currently pursuing an MSc in **Digital Marketing & Data Science** at the **emlyon business school**. 

As a **film** enthusiast, **fashion** lover, and **music** fanatic, I was able to curate an acquired **taste** in these fields. Meanwhile, my years of experience as a Chinese consumer and a trend chaser have given me an acute and perceptive **understanding** of the fast-developing **e-commerce** market and its ever-changing **marketing landscape**. 

My innate **curiosity** and **creativity** drive me to uncover how people behave and create solutions accordingly. In addition, my newly acquired **data analysis** capabilities will equip me to deal with data more **insightfully** and make **informed decisions**. I can't wait to utilize my different skills and learn more in my future career!

Thank you! 谢谢！
