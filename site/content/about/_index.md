Hi, nice to meet you! My name is Mingzi (a.k.a. **Ariana**) **RAO**, a **Chinese** girl exploring her life in **France**.

Originally from a small city called **Chengde**, I am proud of what it holds in as culture and beauty. Born as an **adventurer**, I never stop dreaming of seeing a wider world. Thanks to my Bachelor's courses and its **exchange program** with **Sorbonne University**, I got the chance to continue my studies in France and know this country as it is.

During my time spent in Sorbonne finishing my Master of **International Business and Management**, I developed my interests in **digital marketing** and its related fields. So I am currently pursuing a MSc of **Digital Marketing & Data Science** at the **emlyon business school**, looking forward to turn my inner interests into practical skills.

As a **cinephile**, **fashion** lover and **music** fanatic, I have clear visions and ideas in those fields. In the meanwhile, my years of experience as a Chinese consumer and a trend chaser have given me a deeper understanding of the **e-commerce** market and its ever-changing marketing **strategies**.

My innate **curiosity** and **creativity** drive me to uncover how people behave and create solutions accordingly. In addition, my newly acquired **data analysis** capabilities will provide more informed data to support my ideas. I can't wait to use my different skills and learn more in my future career!
