#### Overview

In a group of 6, we created a (virtual) **digital company** along with its **business plan** explaining its **business model**, the reasons for why it is innovative, and a concrete **marketing strategy** to maximize the adoption of a product/service of our choice (the product/service has to be realistic). The project's objective is to apply and demonstrate our understanding of the topics covered in class and generate a **credible digital strategy** in the context of a startup.

We created a company called **LAB**, a **marketplace** and **social media platform** focusing on **high-end** sportswear fashion. 

LAB enables the sale of sportswear from **collectibles**, **specific designer collaborations**, products with **cultural value**, and high-end brand products. Driven by technology and the latest trends, the platform has also included sport and fashion-related **NFTs** as part of the products.
