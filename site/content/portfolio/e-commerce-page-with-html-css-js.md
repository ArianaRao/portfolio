#### Overview

In this project, I have to use the JSON file provided to display some sneakers on a web page using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. I got to decide my own styling and chose the fonts, colors, layout, icons, and additional images.

The only styling rule: I have to use Skeleton's rows and columns to layout some elements side by side.

Services/tools used:

* **Glitch**
* **Google Fonts**
* **Skeleton**
* **jQuery**
