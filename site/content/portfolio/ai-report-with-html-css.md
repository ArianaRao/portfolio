description: Creation of a documentation page using HTML and CSS.

---
#### Overview

In this project, I have to create a documentation page based on the subject (**Sustainable Development goals**) using **HTML and CSS**. It summarizes the results of my exploratory research and reflects my understanding of the technologies and my subject's issues.

At first, I looked for existing projects interestingly addressing my subject: "_Increase the incomes of small-scale food producers._" Then I summarized four projects that seem relevant to me, following the given detailed structure.

In the end, I focused on only one of these projects. I deepened both the user experience aspects and the technical principle by designing a **UX storyboard** and researching their **AI technology**.

Services/tools used:

* **Glitch**
* **Google Fonts**
* **Skeleton**
* **Normalize**
