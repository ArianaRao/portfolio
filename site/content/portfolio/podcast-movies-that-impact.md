#### Overview

In a group of 6, we should create a **podcast** on a subject based on our course **Web Content Strategy**. All of us as **movie lovers**, we chose "cinema culture" as our subject and decided to make a podcast called "Movies that Impact".

We ended up finishing the deliverables in four dimensions:

1. Written: a landing page of our podcast.
2. Visual: illustration and branding of the landing page.
3. Audio: the podcast trailer and pilot episode.
4. Video: an individual 1-minute video promoting the podcast.
