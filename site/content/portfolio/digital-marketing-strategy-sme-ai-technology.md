#### Overview

##### First report context

In a group of 6, we work as Digital Marketing Officers in an SME (which we chose **Typology** in this case). Our first task is to prepare a comprehensive report for the owner:

* Identify and list the **digital communication activities** of the company.
* Describe all **visible digital marketing efforts** on platforms and channels.
* Evaluate digital presence/traces on both **quantitative/qualitative** levels.
* Evaluate **tone of voice, types of content,** and general **coherence**.
* Collect **insights on performance**.
* Provide a global **evaluation** of the company’s digital marketing **strategy**.

##### Second report context

Our first report on the Digital Marketing Strategy was well-received by the Top management.

Now, they’re interested in this strategy, where AI Tools and functionalities could help improve automation, targeting, performance, and analysis.

So we designed 3 “cases” where AI techs can be used to **reinforce** Digital marketing actions and **add value** to data collection.

Our report includes:

* The AI tech used
* What it does (How it works...)
* How it improves Digital marketing actions
* Show examples of existing actions performed by this technology in other companies
