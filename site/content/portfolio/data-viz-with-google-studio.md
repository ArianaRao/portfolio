#### Overview

In a group of 5, we were set in a situation where we are hired as new **data analysts** for **Marcel**, a French start-up that is starting to establish itself in the French VTC market. As a recent company, there is no advanced analytics process. Particularly, there is no **centralized vision** of the company's activity, with each team doing basic analysis on its own.

The given made-up database contains four tables:

1. Media data: all the data of the media campaigns realized by the company.
2. Campaign names: all the campaign names that have been performed by the company.
3. App data: all the platform's usage data.
4. Rides data: all the trips made by the company and by the other competitors.

Our mission is to make a report using **Google Data Studio** that allows us to have a **360 vision** of the company **business**.
