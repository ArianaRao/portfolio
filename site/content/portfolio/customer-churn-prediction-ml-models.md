description: Prediction of customer churn using ML models.

#### Overview

In a group of 6, we used a telecom company's customers' **database** to **predict** their customer churn using several **machine learning models**.

We have a database with demographic and account-related information about the customers and the services they subscribed to in the telecommunication company. 

First, we **cleaned** and **transformed** this dataset. We explored our data by visualizing and understanding it to know which information is more useful for our analysis and if some adjustments are needed. Then we used some **prediction models**:

* logistic regression
* random forests
* support vector machines

We **tested** these models and **evaluated** their performance in predicting the customer churn.

Finally, we concluded by selecting the best model with hyperparameters.

We focused our report and our analysis on those questions:

* Identify the customers who are going to churn
* Features that **correlate** to customer churn
* Different types of churns 
* **Recommendations** based on the problems discovered
