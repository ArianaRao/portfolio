#### Overview

In a group of 5, we were set in a situation where we work for **Airbnb**. We are responsible for the good development of the Airbnb service for renting in this town.

Until now, the reports have been made in Excel / PowerPoint and Airbnb aims to **digitalize** its reporting with **Power BI** to:

1. Make them more **interactive**.
2. Make them more **industrialized**.
3. Access to anytime to the dashboard on **PC, smartphones,** etc.

Our objective is to make a dashboard in Power BI based on a made-up dataset aiming to:

1. Make a **review of your activities** and present them to the Directory Manager
2. Prepare the analysis to align with the next year's target operating model of Airbnb:
   * **Identify** good and bad practitioners.
   * **Evaluate** the number of bad practitioners and the reasons.
