#### Overview

In a group of 5, we followed up on our common subject: "_Increase the incomes of small-scale food producers._" (Details found in my other individual project: [AI report with HTML/CSS](/portfolio/ai-report-with-html-css/)).

As we already have a theme and a subject in common, we should find a research question within that subject and two projects within that research question.

Along with our project definitions, we created **wireframes** for each of our projects using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), the all-in-one **UX/UI solution** for designing websites, mobile apps, and more.

Services/tools used:

* **Glitch**
* **Google Fonts**
* **Skeleton**
